# landing-page
Odin landing page project

This project involves the creation of a landing page based on a photo of a landing page layout. I decided to craft a landing page based on the song, "Les Fleurs" by Minnie Riperton. I employed what I've learned so far about HTML, CSS, and flexbox to create the page.
